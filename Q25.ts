/*
25. Alien Colors #1: Imagine an alien was just shot down in a game. Create a 
variable called alien_color and assign it a value of 'green', 'yellow', or 'red'. 
• Write an if statement to test whether the alien’s color is green. If it is, print 
a message that the player just earned 5 points. 
• Write one version of this program that passes the if test and another that 
fails. (The version that fails will have no output.)

// making the array variable having the three valuess of color

let alien_color= 'green'

// now the if test pass version

if (alien_color == "green"){
  console.log('the player earned the 5 points')
}

//noow the version that fails the if statment

if (alien_color == 'yellow'){}
